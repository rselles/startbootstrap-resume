                                | Before this, I led the rollout of social authentication for the Rider team. SMS-based verification was expensive and often annoyed users, especially those who traveled or changed phone numbers. We added social logins from Apple, Google, and Facebook, which made signing in faster and safer while cutting SMS costs. This change made onboarding smoother and helped users recover their accounts more easily.

This work kept us ahead of European regulations and helped maintain high payment success rates, which directly affected revenue.

                                | I joined the Supercreators team to rebuild B2B ticketing tools that were slowing down enterprise customers.

By updating the self-service process, we opened up new revenue opportunities and made support easier.

                                | Our biggest project was migrating a key legacy service that accounted for over 40% of Eventbrite's fee income.

The new system was stronger, easier to update, and let the team release features faster without worrying about breaking important revenue streams.

                                | I helped scale a mid-term rental platform by automating property management and expanding distribution. Spotahome's growth relied on getting more quality properties and showing them to renters quickly. On the Integrations Team, I built custom connectors to third-party platforms so landlords could manage listings across multiple channels from a single dashboard. This cut down on manual work, improved accuracy, and sped up property acquisition.
                            p
                                | One big problem was outdated occupancy data, with properties shown as available when they were not. This frustrated renters and wasted sales efforts. I improved the property management system to sync occupancy in real time, boosting conversion rates and freeing local teams from manual updates and complaints.
                            p
                                | I also led the development of Spotahome's public API, which served as the foundation for partnerships with other platforms. By sharing property data and booking workflows through a well-designed API, we enabled large-scale distribution and opened up new revenue streams without adding extra work for the team.

                                | Pingvalue was scaling rapidly, and the legacy infrastructure couldn't keep up. The APIs were tightly coupled with Google App Engine, limiting our ability to scale and manage environments effectively. I led the move to Kubernetes, which removed vendor lock-in. The new setup made scaling easier, reduced costs, and helped new developers get started faster.
